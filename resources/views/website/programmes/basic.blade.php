                    The National Health Act (NHAct) 2014 is amilestone in the national momentum to strengthen
                    Nigeria's health system, achieve Universal Health Coverage (UHC), and improve the nation's
                    Health indices with the consequential improvement in economic productivity.</p>
                <P>
                    The NHAct 2014 was enacted to ensure improved health outeomes, by providing a legal
                    framework for the provision of health care services and establish an organizational and
                    management structure for the health system in Nigeria. To achieve the important objective of
                    providing quality healthcare services to all Nigerians, the Act specifies that all Nigerians shall
                    be entitled to a Basic Minimum Package of Health Services (BMPHS). </P>
                <P>The BMPHS is a set of preventive, protective, promotive, curative, and rehabilitative health services
                    to be developed and reviewed from time to time by the Minister of Health, after consultation with
                    the National Council on Health (NCH).</P>
                <P>
                    The Basic Health Care Provision Fund (BHCPF or "The Fund") was established under Section
                    11 ofthe Act, as the principal funding vehicle for the BMPHS, whilst at the same time, serving to
                    increase the fiscal space and overall financing to the health sector. It is expected that the
                    attendant service upscale arising from application of this funding, would assist Nigeria achieve
                    UHC. Funding of the BHCPF would be derived, as stipulated in the Act,from (a) an annual grant from
                    the <b class="text-primary">Federal Government of Nigeria </b> of not less than one per cent (16) of
                    its Consolidated Revenue Fund (CRF); (b) grants by international donor partners; (C) funds trom any
                    other sources, inclusive of the private sector. </P>
